# 🎯 Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built with JavaScript that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating the use of JavaScript functions, loops, user input, and conditional logic.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a maximum number.
2. A random target number is generated between 1 and the maximum.
3. The user continues guessing until the correct number is found.
4. After each guess, the game gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.
5. The total number of attempts is displayed when the user wins.

## 🧠 Features

- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Hint-based feedback (Too High / Too Low)
- Counts total attempts
- Fully interactive in the browser using `prompt()` and `alert()`

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML (for the base structure)
- JavaScript (core game logic)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## 🚀 Getting Started

To play the game:

1. Clone this repository:

Enter Your Maximum Number: 50
Enter Your First Guess: 25
Too High!
Enter a New Guess: 10
Too Low!
Enter a New Guess: 18
Correct! You got it in 3 attempts!
